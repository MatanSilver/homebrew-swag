# homebrew-swag

This repo contains the results of my fiddling with homebrew packages. Most of these will consist of projects that I've forked and adapted to be installed with homebrew.

# usage

To add this repo as a tap, use `brew tap matansilver/swag`. To then install any package found in here, you can `brew install <package_name>` and homebrew should automatically search through the added taps when it doesn't find the package in the main repos.
